                the CV</h2><img class="image" id="r_checklist__image_cdr_xvy_1pb" src="../image/r_ch.jpg"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Step
                    1</strong> – Prepare for everything. Collect all the important documents, your
                certificates, your achievements and put it in one place. Also make a list of all the
                things that you want to add in your resume. Doing this will save a lot of
                    time.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Step 2</strong> – Write the header. List all your contact details and
                your name in bold.</p><p class="p">Never write “Resume” on the top.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Step 3</strong> – Plan
                your objective and write it. Read what the company seeks to achieve in the next five
                years. List your personal objectives for the next five years. After this match the
                two and list all the points that are common to both the lists. Always include the
                position and the function you desire.</p><p class="p">For example, “Senior Web Developer in a
                Software Development Firm” is a good objective.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Step 4</strong> – For the next
                part, list your educational qualifications. Include specific grades, marks,
                scholarships, and all your achievements. Convey to the employer that you have more
                than the basic qualification required for the job. Write the qualifications in a
                reverse chronological order (the latest on the top). You can also have the education
                section in a tabular form.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Step 5</strong> – This step is the game changer.
                Design your experience section. Add all your projects and any sidekicks that you
                have been a part of. Any internships or volunteer activities, even the events that
                you organized in your college, should be included. Let the employer know that you
                have worked before, you are not new in this field. Also mention the time period, and
                provide a brief description about each project.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Step 6</strong> – The next step
                is to add skills in your resume. Soft skills and hard skills should be
                differentiated. The purpose of soft skills is to showcase your personal capability
                whereas the hard skills depict the occupational skills you have to perform the
                desired job. Both must be exclusive of each other. Always mention these skills in
                bullet points.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Step 7</strong>– Add the finishing touches. Make sure that the
                font size is not more than 12, and the resume doesn’t exceed 2 pages. Also make sure
                that the resume is well formatted. Look for any grammatical errors. And the finally,
                save a .PDF format of your resume after naming it right. Always include your name
                and the word “resume”, in the name of the file.</p></section>
