                    <p class="p"> Most CVs include your personal information, your education and
                        qualifications, your work experience, your interests and achievements, your
                        skills, and references. Also experienced people tailor your resume to the
                        job you are applying for. Use a modern but professional format. However,
                        there is no set format for a CV, what you include is up to you.</p>

                        person. Companies want someone who works well with others and can take

                            give a reason why. For instance, if you are applying for a job at a
                            publishing house, put something like: I enjoy reading the great American
                            writers such as Twain and Hemingway because I think their writing gives
                            a unique perspective into American culture at the time they were
