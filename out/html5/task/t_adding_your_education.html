    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">It’s common to include your education on your resume, especially if you are applying
        to a job that requires a degree. If you’re a few years into your career, your resume’s
        education section can be minimized at the bottom of your resume. </p>
        <section class="section context"><div class="p">Unless you’re applying in a career that puts extra emphasis on education (like
                academia, law, or medicine), most job seekers can get away with providing only the
                following information on their resume:<ul class="ul" id="t_adding_your_education__ul_hg2_jds_1pb">
                    <li class="li">Name of Institution</li>

                graduated college, your education section goes above your work experience and
                includes more detail. Skills developed in school are real skills that have value in
                the professional world. Recent grads can include relevant coursework, societies,
                organizations, and extracurriculars that strengthen their candidacy.</p><p class="p">Awards,
                Accolades, and Certifications can be embedded in the work experience and skills
                sections of your resume. However, if you would like to highlight them, they could
                warrant a section of their own. Either way, relevant certifications and honors will
                increase your credibility.</p><p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://zety.com/uk/blog/cv-education" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">https://zety.com/uk/blog/cv-education</a></p></section>

                        sections. Start with your recent academic achievement. College students
                        pursuing a degree should write “anticipated completion date.”</p>
