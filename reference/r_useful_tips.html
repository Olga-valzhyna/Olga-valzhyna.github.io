        </section>
        <div class="example" id="r_useful_tips__example_l2l_13s_1pb">
            <ul class="ul" id="r_useful_tips__ul_kgf_jhs_1pb">
                <li class="li">I am a hardworking team-player</li>
                <li class="li">I always go the extra mile</li>
                <li class="li">I am a strong communicator</li>
                <li class="li">I think outside the box</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p">These phrases do not impress employers.</p>
            <p class="p">The problem with these cliché phrases is that they are vague, overused and don’t tell
                recruiters anything specific about you.</p>
            <p class="p">Focus on describing your industry specific skills, experience and achievements,
                because they are what recruiters will be looking for.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="section" id="r_useful_tips__section_rlw_rhs_1pb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Dealing with gaps in employment</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Long periods of unemployment can be off-putting for employers because it simply
                appears as though you have not been doing anything during that period – unless you
                state otherwise.</p>
            <div class="p">So, if you have any periods of unemployment that lasted over a month or so, then try
                to fill them with constructive activities to make yourself look proactive and
                positive. For example:<ul class="ul" id="r_useful_tips__ul_f2g_33s_1pb">
                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Studying</strong> – With details of qualifications gained or working
                        towards</li>
                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Travel</strong> – Great to demonstrate planning, organisation and people
                        skills</li>
                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Volunteer roles or personal projects</strong> – e.g. caring for a family
                        member, working for a community initiative</li>
                </ul></div>
            <p class="p">If you’ve had time out for personal reasons such as a serious illness, then don’t be
                worried about including it on your CV – employers should not discriminate against
                youfor it. Just keep the detail light and focus on highlighting your value
                throughout the rest of your CV.</p>

        <section class="section" id="r_useful_tips__section_ndz_43s_1pb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">CV Language</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The language used in your CV should be professional, persuasive, descriptive and
                grammatically perfect throughout.</p>
            <p class="p">It should read like a sales brochure for a luxury product; leaving the reader
                desperate to call you, just in case they miss out on the opportunity of hiring
                you.</p>
            <p class="p">The language used in your CV gives recruiters an insight into your written
                communication skills and your professionalism, so make it count.</p>
            <p class="p">Avoid using basic language, because it makes you look like a basic candidate, when
                you need to look outstanding.</p>
            <div class="note note note_note" id="r_useful_tips__note_bhv_53s_1pb"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> 
                <p class="p">If you struggle to write professionally or English isn’t your first language, I
                    would recommend using a free grammar checking tool like <a class="xref" href="https://grammarly.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=10&amp;aff_id=14555" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Grammarly</a> – It highlights your
                    mistakes and provides suggestions for corrections.</p>
