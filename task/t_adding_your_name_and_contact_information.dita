    <title>Adding Your name and contact information</title>
    <shortdesc>It might seem obvious, but job seekers sometimes forget a key piece of contact
        information in this section. Double check and make it as easy as possible for recruiters to
        contact you for a job interview.</shortdesc>

            <p>The top of your resume should include:<image href="../IMAGES/name.png"

                <cmd>You donâ€™t need to include your full address but do add your city, state, and
                    zip code. Recruiters often search for local candidates first.</cmd>

                <cmd>Use a professional sounding email address. Consider creating a free Gmail
