    <title>Adding Your education</title>
    <shortdesc>It’s common to include your education on your resume, especially if you are applying
        to a job that requires a degree. If you’re a few years into your career, your resume’s
        education section can be minimized at the bottom of your resume. </shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context><p>Unless you’re applying in a career that puts extra emphasis on education (like
                academia, law, or medicine), most job seekers can get away with providing only the
                following information on their resume:<ul id="ul_hg2_jds_1pb">
                    <li>Name of Institution</li>
                    <li>Degree</li>
                    <li>School Location</li>
                    <li>Years Attended</li>
                </ul></p><image href="../image/t_aed.jpg" width="600" id="image_uyd_5lz_1pb"/><image
                href="../image/t_aed2.jpg" width="600" id="image_urn_vlz_1pb"/><p>If you’ve recently
                graduated college, your education section goes above your work experience and
                includes more detail. Skills developed in school are real skills that have value in
                the professional world. Recent grads can include relevant coursework, societies,
                organizations, and extracurriculars that strengthen their candidacy.</p><p>Awards,
                Accolades, and Certifications can be embedded in the work experience and skills
                sections of your resume. However, if you would like to highlight them, they could
                warrant a section of their own. Either way, relevant certifications and honors will
                increase your credibility.</p><p><xref href="https://zety.com/uk/blog/cv-education"

                    <p>The reverse chronological format is the best choice for most education
                        sections. Start with your recent academic achievement. College students
                        pursuing a degree should write “anticipated completion date.”</p>

                        job description. Hiring managers and applicant tracking system software will

                    <p>Your writing shouldn’t immediately show your age. Just include the type of
                        degree and university. Your GPA is not relevant. If you’ve attended several
                        schools, focus on education that is pertinent to the job.</p>

                    <p>Write about earned honors, such as summa cum laude, or leadership roles. Many
                        recruiters value this type of experience over the specifics of your degree.
                        This is important for recent college graduates and high students with little
                        work experience.</p>

                        Many industries, such as finance, healthcare, social work, and IT, require

                        education section near the top of the page. Remember to begin with your

                    <p>When writing about a doctoral degree, include the name of your academic
                        advisor, dissertation subject, and the date it was published that name of
                        the scholarly journal.</p>

                        training or certifications. For example, if you’ve completed an
                        apprenticeship relevant to the job title, place this information in your
                        resume education section.</p>

                    <p>Never embellish the writing in your resume education section. A hiring
                        manager may verify your credentials, so be honest about colleges attended,
                        academic achievements, training, and certifications.</p>

                    <p>Skip the cutesy, flippant writing workarounds, such as “recent graduate from
                        the school of life.” If you don’t have formal schooling to include, beef up
                        your skills and work history section.</p>

                        <p>Adding a study abroad semester or year to your resume can show employers
                            that you’re a go-getter. This information doesn’t need to take up much
                            space, and should be included in the education section as well.</p>
                        <p>The correct place to put study abroad on your resume is just below the
                            university you graduated from. </p>
